/**
 * <p>
 * This is a simple sound class that can play sounds in some formats (like wav).
 * It cannot play files in mp3 format. It will play sounds immediately and can
 * play the same sound multiple times in a row without interruption. Most sound
 * classes in comparison lag the first time you play a sound and can't handle
 * playing the same sound many times in a row quickly, so this is a great
 * solution for playing short sounds many times in a row. For looping a long
 * music track, you should use another option such as MediaPlayer.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that merely loading a single sound using this class will wake up the
 * sound system and remove the lag from the first sound played even if it is
 * played with another class such as AudioClip. If you want to compare the
 * performance of another sound class to this one, you should make sure this
 * class is not used anywhere in your code while testing the other class.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you want to initialize the sound with multiple channels, you can do so in
 * the second constructor. This could make sense if you already know you will be
 * playing this sound many times in extremely quick succession, but most of the
 * time it is not needed because whenever a sound is told to play and there
 * isn't a channel available, a new channel will be created automatically.
 * Example Usage:
 * 
 * <pre>
     Sound.init();
     Sound sound = new Sound("<a href=
'https://github.com/tedMcleod/javafx.sound.demo/raw/refs/heads/main/src/resources/smw_coin.wav' >smw_coin.wav"</a>);
     for(int i=0; i<10; i++) {
         sound.play();
         Thread.sleep(100);
     }
 * </pre>
