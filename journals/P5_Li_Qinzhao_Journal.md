Period: Ferrante 5

## WEDNESDAY 5/21/2025 (1.5 hours)

\> Worked with Sharvil to clean up some of the engine code to make it more understandable, and then got acclimated with this new iteration of the game engine.

\> Made minor code improvements all around.

\> Discussed and further polished our game idea during class, and updated the README to reflect those changes.

\> Drew up a rough spritesheet for a new character that we will be adding, as well as the run cycle.

\> Added a rough implementation for animated colliders, which will be used for the new character. They are essentially AABB colliders that change shape at timed intervals, similar to how animated sprites work.

\> Started on the official character implementation by adding data classes to store character stats.

## THURSDAY 5/22/2025 -> MONDAY 5/26/2025 (0 hours)

\> I studied for and took AP Seminar, then had a day long CS competition, and then went on a road trip with my grandparents from China.

## TUESDAY 5/27/2025 (3 hours)

\> Continued to set up a generalized ability system with projectiles and signals connecting them to the player.

\> Set down the groundwork for adding new characters with abilities (this should be done by Wednesday).

## THURSDAY 5/29/2025 (2.5 hours)

\> Converted ability system from just data to actual activatable abilities.

\> Ported over the shotgun item to the ability system.

\> Started generalized ability casting system (unpushed).

## FRIDAY 5/30/2025 (1.5 hours)

\> Finished the ability and casting system.

\> Implemented the first ability for my character.

\> Add the ability for areas to render themselves on screen (doesn't use global transform but shape is correct).

## SUNDAY 6/1/2025 (1 hours)

\> Make nodes able to be disabled and hidden.

\> Update ability system to disable projectiles after a certain amount of time.

\> Update my character's ability to deal damage and be more accurate.
