\> Worked with Sharvil to clean up some of the engine code to make it more understandable, and then got acclimated with this new iteration of the game engine.

\> Made minor code improvements all around.

\> Discussed and further polished our game idea during class, and updated the README to reflect those changes.

\> Drew up a rough spritesheet for a new character that we will be adding, as well as the run cycle.

\> Added a rough implementation for animated colliders, which will be used for the new character. They are essentially AABB colliders that change shape at timed intervals, similar to how animated sprites work.

\> Started on the official character implementation by adding data classes to store character stats.
